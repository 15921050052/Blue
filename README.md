Blue 0.8α

A mod of Scratch 2.0 by MIT

This is the mod I am making based off Scratch. I have absolutly no idea how to use Github, but I wanted to make my mod open-source, and my friend suggested Github.

The current public version is 0.8α, and can be viewed <a href="http://blue.gwiddle.org/alpha/">here.</a>
